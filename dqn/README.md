# Deep Q-Learning Network(DQN)
This is an pytorch-version implementation of ["Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning"](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf). In this project, the `FlappyBird-v0` was choosen as the training environment. So, it's very cool to try it!

## Requirements
